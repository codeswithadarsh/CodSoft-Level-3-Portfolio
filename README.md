Project 1: Personal Website
Personal Website

My personal website is a showcase of my skills, projects, and interests. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The website includes sections such as About Me, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact. I also integrated a simple contact form for visitors to get in touch with me directly.
